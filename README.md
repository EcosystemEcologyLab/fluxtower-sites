The goal of fluxtower-sites is to estimate total above ground biomass for the "footprints" of flux towers from a variety or raster data products.  This is a collaboration between [CCT Data Science](https://datascience.cct.arizona.edu/) and the [Moore lab](https://snre.arizona.edu/david-moore) at University of Arizona.
